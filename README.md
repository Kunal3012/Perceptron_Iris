## Abstract

This project explores the application of a Perceptron model for classifying iris species using the Iris dataset. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, standardize the features, and train the Perceptron. The model achieved a train accuracy of 0.84 and a test accuracy of 0.76, demonstrating its effectiveness in iris classification.

## Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset used for species classification. This project focuses on employing a Perceptron model to classify iris species based on their features.

## Methods

### Data Preparation

- Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 50% test size.
- Standardized the features using StandardScaler.

### Perceptron Model

- Created a Perceptron model with 400 iterations (epochs).
- Trained the Perceptron model on the standardized training data.

## Results

- Perceptron Model Performance:
  - Train Accuracy: 0.84
  - Test Accuracy: 0.76

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of a Perceptron model in classifying iris species with respectable accuracy. The model's ability to correctly classify iris species demonstrates its usefulness in practical classification tasks.
